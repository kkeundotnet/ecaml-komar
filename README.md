Template syntax
---

* `<% %>` are for code.
* `%` in the beginning of line is for code too.
* `<%= %>` are for "print this expression"; if `-esc-p` is set â€” also escape string (useful for
  HTML).
* `<%=raw %>` are also for "print this expression", but do not escape anything inside even if
  `-esc-p` is set.
